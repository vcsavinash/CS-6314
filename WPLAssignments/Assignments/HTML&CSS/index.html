	  <h2 id="about">About me : </h2>
	  <p>Computer Industry has revolutionized modern day life and the thought of being a part of that revolution always thrilled me. During my final year, I worked on the topic 'Solar Flat Plate Collectors' for my research. For this, project, predictions on the heat had to be obtained from the Sun, and had to be forecast for continuity. It was here that I got fascinated by the concept of predicting the future. I wanted to learn how future predictions are made. I learnt later that 'Artificial Intelligence' is used to forecast the situations and the most interesting facet of this is that it imitates the human brain. I found it quite interesting, and to learn more about it, I wish to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science. </p>
	  <p>During college I participate in Coding Challenges held in our College National tech Fests. Even now I participate in Online Coding Challenges like Hacker Rank, Top Coder, Hackathons where I get to practice on lots of new problems. This helped me in taking Oracle certification in Java and have been certified as 'Oracle Certified Associate, Java SE 7 Programmer'.</p>
	  <p>After completing my under graduation, I joined 'iNautix Technologies Pvt. Ltd.', a BNY Mellon Company based in Chennai. I was given training on Basics of Java Language, Structured Query language (SQL) and UNIX Operating Systems. I am worked as an Applications Developer and was part of the Small Business Administration One (SBA One) applications development project. I was part of the JAVA development team and developed the Guaranty Purchase Module for SBA, (a US government-based loan providing organization) using XML, Java, JSP, Spring and Hibernate. </p>
	  <p>Also was part of Prod bug fixes, improvements, Change requests in the Loan Origination-Community Advantage Module. Used the framework developed by our team, namely Intelli Business Forms (IBF). It configures the questions which are required to be answered and navigate them according to the answers and the sections completed (from the borrowers- before the loan is processed). This framework is written using Java, Knockout JS, Spring, Hibernate and JSP. I have also prepared Questionnaire, a tool used to configure questions which are required for any quiz, survey being conducted for the company. This was also displayed for Corporate Trust-Expo, 2015, conducted in our Company. I also developed a Coder Challenge tool, which compiles and runs the test cases for different set of problems chosen.</p>
	  <p>Now, I am pursuing Master's in Computer Science in Data Science specialization in University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas</p>
	  <h2 id="projects"> Projects : </h2>
	  <p > -  Implemented scalable solutions for Linked Lists, Selection sort, Tertiary search, AVL Tree, BFS, DFS, Topological Sort,  Graph Traversal, Dijkstra's, Hash Map using Eclipse IDE and Java. </p>
	  <p> -  Designed and developed a C program that creates a simulated environment in which the unused bit in the flags of the inode in UNIX V6 file system is used, to maximum size capacity from 16MB to 32MB. It reads a series of commands from the user and executes the same such as initialization, creation, copying the file contents and removal of files/directories</p>
